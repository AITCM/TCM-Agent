These discoveries have enabled the Mendelian randomization (MR) design, which uses genetic variation as a natural experiment to improve causal inferences from observational data. By analogy with the random assignment of treatment in randomized controlled trials, the random segregation of genetic alleles when DNA is transmitted from parents to offspring at gamete formation is expected to reduce confounding in genetic associations. Mendelian randomization analyses make a set of assumptions that must hold for valid results. Provided that the assumptions are well justified for the genetic variants that are employed as instrumental variables, MR studies can inform on whether a putative risk factor likely has a causal effect on the disease or not. Mendelian randomization has been increasingly applied over recent years to predict the efficacy and safety of existing and novel drugs targeting cardiovascular risk factors and to explore the repurposing potential of available drugs. This review article describes the principles of the MR design and some applications in cardiovascular epidemiology.',\n",

       "   'abstract': {'complete': 'Elucidating the causes of stroke is key to developing effective preventive strategies. The Mendelian randomization approach leverages genetic variants related to an exposure of interest to investigate the effects of varying that exposure on disease risk. The random allocation of genetic variants at conception reduces confounding from environmental factors and thus strengthens causal inference, analogous to treatment allocation in a randomized controlled trial. With the recent explosion in the availability of human genetic data, Mendelian randomization has proven a valuable tool for studying risk factors for stroke. In this review, we provide an overview of recent developments in the application of Mendelian randomization to unravel the pathophysiology of stroke subtypes and identify therapeutic targets for clinical translation. The approach has offered novel insight into the differential effects of risk factors and antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and anticoagulant drug classes on risk of stroke subtypes. Analyses have further facilitated the prioritization of novel drug targets, such as for inflammatory pathways underlying large artery atherosclerotic stroke and for the coagulation cascade that contributes to cardioembolic stroke. With continued methodological advances coupled with the rapidly increasing availability of genetic data related to a broad range of stroke phenotypes, the potential for Mendelian randomization in this context is expanding exponentially.',\n",

       "   'abstract': {'complete': 'Randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are two study designs that provide randomized evidence in human biological and medical research. Both exploit the power of randomization to provide unconfounded estimates of causal effect. However, randomized trials and Mendelian randomization studies have very different study designs and scientific objectives. As a result, despite sometimes being referred to as \"nature\\'s randomized trial,\" a Mendelian randomization study cannot be used to replace a randomized trial but instead provides complementary information. In this review, we explain the similarities and differences between randomized trials and Mendelian randomization studies, and suggest several ways that Mendelian randomization can be used to directly inform and improve the design of randomized trials illustrated with practical examples. We conclude by describing how Mendelian randomization studies can employ the principles of trial design to be framed as \"naturally randomized trials\" that can provide a template for the design of future randomized trials evaluating therapies directed against genetically validated targets.',\n",
